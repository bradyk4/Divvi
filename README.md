# Divvi

Divi is an application that will allow users to create a group with other users and split a payment between the users in that group. 

## Description

Divi is an application that will allow users to create a group with other users and split a payment between the users in that group. Bills can be split by percentage, dollar amount, and split evenly. Expenses can be split between as few as 1 other member or as many as 10 other people. The payments will be handled by third party payment processing to ensure a high level of information security. This will allow users to eliminate overhead costs, such as a combined bill that one person has to cover until the other repays them, and instead have each user pay their respective share.
